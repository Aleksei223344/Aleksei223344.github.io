            <h2>Crazy Detailed Story Of Him</h2>
            <p><em>Toxi$ Creativity.</em> The rapper's career began as an English-speaking performer. Even before graduating from high school, Toxi$ released an album called Greener Days. It included seven tracks, including the hit I Say Ya. The musician's debut release immediately attracted the attention of famous Russian rappers, including Big Baby Tape, who invited Smelyansky to write songs in his native language.</p>       
            <p>Toxi$ listened to the advice and in early 2020 presented the single "TAGA", recorded in the style of minimalistic trap. The rapper then joined the creative association RANDOM CREW, which included trap stars such as OG Buda and 163ONMYNECK.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <strong>Toxi$ is a Russian rapper</strong> known for his energetic tracks and engaging social media presence. His music reflects contemporary youth culture, addressing themes of love and personal experiences that resonate with fans
            </blockquote>
            <p>Smelyansky considers himself a romantic who dreams of children, and calls the rescue of a girl from under the wheels of a car the most memorable act. In the fairer sex, he primarily appreciates such qualities as kindness and attentiveness. Another important parameter for Andrey is height. He is not tall (170 cm), so he would like the girl he loves to be shorter than him.</p>
            <p><strong>Toxi$ now.</strong> At the end of 2023, Toxi$ pleased fans with another release - the album Hotshot, where he presented several bright features with Big Baby Tape, B Soul, OG Buda and other bright artists. Fans noted the artist's serious approach, sincerity, and the presence of "branded vocal inventions."</p>
